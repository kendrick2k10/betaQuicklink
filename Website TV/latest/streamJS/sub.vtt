00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:10.708
Sister!

00:01:14.208 --> 00:01:15.208
Sister!

00:01:18.291 --> 00:01:20.791
Xian, I'm coming for you.

00:01:24.375 --> 00:01:26.958
JINSHAN TEMPLE, ZHENJIANG

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:38.000
Today, insects awaken, and spring begins.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.208
We two snake sisters

00:01:40.708 --> 00:01:42.416
will overturn Jinshan Temple.

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:33.208
Vajra-samādhi, the power of stillness.

00:02:33.291 --> 00:02:37.500
All living things are contained in me.

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:39.125
Go!

00:02:59.166 --> 00:03:00.333
Take her!

00:03:11.583 --> 00:03:12.625
Sister!

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:17.333
Aum mani padme hūm.

00:03:37.875 --> 00:03:38.958
Xian!

00:03:39.875 --> 00:03:41.250
Xian!

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:43.416
Master!

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.166
You're so powerful. Leave her be.

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:48.500
{\an8}Please let her go.

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:49.875
Sister!

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.958
-Verta.
-Sister.

00:03:56.583 --> 00:03:58.583
I caused all this.

00:03:58.666 --> 00:04:00.000
I don't blame him.

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.125
That useless man. He's not your Xuan.

00:04:06.791 --> 00:04:09.500
Verta, the monk
won't make things hard for you.

00:04:10.541 --> 00:04:11.791
This child.

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.625
Give him to his father.

00:04:14.458 --> 00:04:15.625
No!

00:04:19.791 --> 00:04:20.916
Verta.

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:22.875
Keep going!

00:04:22.958 --> 00:04:23.916
Sister.

00:04:24.416 --> 00:04:25.666
Sister.

00:04:28.875 --> 00:04:30.541
Sister!

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:47.208
To Hangzhou's Leifeng Pagoda,
for eternity.

00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:48.375
Be a lesson to others.

00:05:02.708 --> 00:05:04.791
Sins.

00:05:06.208 --> 00:05:08.625
Fahai, you're a joke.

00:05:09.166 --> 00:05:10.541
Lust, murder…

00:05:10.625 --> 00:05:12.291
You broke every taboo.

00:05:12.375 --> 00:05:14.416
What gives you the right to persecute us?

00:05:14.916 --> 00:05:17.875
I practice my faith,
but I still have my demons.

00:05:17.958 --> 00:05:19.000
I regret that.

00:05:21.583 --> 00:05:22.708
I have no right.

00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:26.583
But Dharma is greater than me
and is eternal.

00:05:27.083 --> 00:05:29.375
I took her in obedience to it.

00:05:29.458 --> 00:05:30.625
Excuses!

00:05:30.708 --> 00:05:32.208
Dharma this, Dharma that.

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:34.500
We live in peace

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.375
and bother no one.

00:05:37.875 --> 00:05:39.666
And yet you have to destroy us.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.500
You're only stronger than us.

00:05:43.583 --> 00:05:45.666
That's all!

00:05:47.625 --> 00:05:49.250
I'm not going to take you.

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:50.708
Go away.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.500
You useless man.

00:05:54.583 --> 00:05:56.333
You never managed to help Blanca.

00:05:56.875 --> 00:05:58.166
In every incarnation,

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.125
you just hurt her.

00:06:01.333 --> 00:06:04.500
Becoming a monk
doesn't free you of your bonds.

00:06:05.958 --> 00:06:07.291
I'm not leaving.

00:06:09.958 --> 00:06:11.958
I'll kill you, you stinking monk!

00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:24.416
Entangled fates and empty lives.

00:06:25.375 --> 00:06:27.250
The pursuit of illusion

00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.208
bars entry to Nirvana.

00:06:31.208 --> 00:06:34.541
Go to the place of self-annihilation.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:06.708
Sister…

00:07:58.583 --> 00:08:01.500
GREAT TREASURES SUTRA:
EVIL OPENS FOUR PATHS.

00:08:01.583 --> 00:08:05.791
HELL, HUNGRY GHOST, BEAST,
AND ASURAVILLE.

00:08:05.875 --> 00:08:11.708
ASURAVILLE, THE PATH TRAVELED
BY THE OBSESSED AND THE QUARRELSOME.

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.750
What is this place?

00:09:13.250 --> 00:09:14.916
Am I in Leifeng Pagoda too?

00:09:16.625 --> 00:09:17.666
Sister!

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:19.583
Sister!

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:21.833
Blanca!

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:26.541
Fahai, you bald donkey.

00:09:26.625 --> 00:09:28.291
What is this place?

00:09:28.375 --> 00:09:29.541
Show yourself!

00:10:13.875 --> 00:10:14.916
Where are my powers?

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.666
Who are you?

00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:38.916
Your name?

00:11:49.958 --> 00:11:50.875
Run!

00:12:15.375 --> 00:12:16.500
I'm out of ammunition.

00:12:16.583 --> 00:12:17.416
What?

00:12:41.083 --> 00:12:42.083
Get in.

00:13:04.916 --> 00:13:05.750
Thank you.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.916
You're new here, aren't you?

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.125
I'm Sun. Sister Sun.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.583
Come on.

00:13:36.166 --> 00:13:37.000
Sun--

00:13:37.833 --> 00:13:38.708
Sun…

00:13:40.208 --> 00:13:41.625
What is this place?

00:13:42.291 --> 00:13:44.375
Asuraville, devil town.

00:13:45.583 --> 00:13:46.833
Asuraville?

00:13:51.125 --> 00:13:52.000
Hurry, go inside.

00:13:52.083 --> 00:13:54.416
That blasted Bull-Horse gang can't be far.

00:14:06.541 --> 00:14:08.500
Who was the guy that saved us?

00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:09.958
Him?

00:14:10.041 --> 00:14:12.000
He thinks he's a hero,

00:14:12.083 --> 00:14:13.208
but he's not so strong.

00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:14.625
Also, he doesn't take sides.

00:14:14.708 --> 00:14:17.500
In this world,
the weak don't have a choice.

00:14:30.541 --> 00:14:31.458
Come on.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:52.416
This is Octopus's territory. Our refuge.

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.916
You saw how dangerous it is out there.

00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.708
In here, it's a bit safer.

00:15:01.333 --> 00:15:02.708
But not totally.

00:15:03.958 --> 00:15:05.333
What dynasty are you from?

00:15:06.291 --> 00:15:07.250
Dynasty?

00:15:08.291 --> 00:15:09.666
The Great Song.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.000
What's your dynasty?

00:15:12.125 --> 00:15:14.333
1,000 years after yours.

00:15:15.083 --> 00:15:16.125
You wouldn't get it.

00:15:16.625 --> 00:15:18.958
Here, there's folk from every era.

00:15:19.041 --> 00:15:22.583
Humans, demons,
and those Bullheads and Horsefaces.

00:15:24.583 --> 00:15:25.750
I came two months ago.

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:27.666
I was rock climbing

00:15:28.166 --> 00:15:29.666
and 2 m from the peak,

00:15:30.250 --> 00:15:32.833
I slipped and fell.

00:15:33.416 --> 00:15:35.750
When I opened my eyes, here I was.

00:15:37.083 --> 00:15:38.125
Here, I learned that

00:15:38.708 --> 00:15:40.791
the spirit world is real.

00:16:01.083 --> 00:16:03.916
However, these demons aren't so scary.

00:16:06.291 --> 00:16:08.583
They're extremely strong,
but they can't shape-shift.

00:16:09.083 --> 00:16:11.625
And no magic powers like in the legends.

00:16:13.583 --> 00:16:14.875
Asuraville…

00:16:15.375 --> 00:16:16.916
What is it, really?

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.083
It's not heaven, hell,
nor the human realm.

00:16:20.791 --> 00:16:23.541
In Asuraville, it's dog-eat-dog.

00:16:23.625 --> 00:16:25.708
Neither humans nor spirits want to die.

00:16:25.791 --> 00:16:26.958
You have to be strong.

00:16:27.791 --> 00:16:30.875
You know it, babe.

00:16:32.833 --> 00:16:36.416
I keep telling you, just be mine.

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.458
You won't need to risk your life

00:16:38.541 --> 00:16:40.000
just to survive.

00:16:41.166 --> 00:16:42.750
-Another little sweetie--
-Get lost.

00:16:44.208 --> 00:16:46.125
Why so serious?

00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:53.375
Why waste your youth…

00:17:04.125 --> 00:17:05.041
Let's go.

00:17:11.958 --> 00:17:12.916
In here, hurry.

00:17:23.708 --> 00:17:25.000
Want some soda?

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:31.750
Let me show you some books.

00:17:32.291 --> 00:17:33.375
They'll tell you

00:17:33.458 --> 00:17:36.250
what has happened in the last 1,000 years.

00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:39.041
Is it strange skipping all that time?

00:17:40.333 --> 00:17:41.875
I did it before.

00:17:41.958 --> 00:17:43.166
500 years that time.

00:17:43.250 --> 00:17:44.208
Really?

00:17:44.916 --> 00:17:47.000
This book isn't bad. Have a read.

00:17:48.125 --> 00:17:49.291
Besides books, there's this.

00:17:50.083 --> 00:17:52.000
There's lots of stuff stored inside.

00:17:53.083 --> 00:17:56.166
Check out what you missed out on.

00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:58.750
Maybe it's not so much.

00:18:06.041 --> 00:18:07.208
Here, you try.

00:18:07.791 --> 00:18:08.833
Strong stance.

00:18:08.916 --> 00:18:10.333
Firm grip.

00:18:13.125 --> 00:18:14.291
Try again.

00:19:40.125 --> 00:19:41.041
Yes.

00:19:41.833 --> 00:19:43.458
The city is alive.

00:19:43.541 --> 00:19:44.541
Alive?

00:19:46.166 --> 00:19:47.375
There's a lot more weirdness.

00:19:47.458 --> 00:19:48.666
You haven't seen anything yet.

00:19:50.708 --> 00:19:53.916
Whatever this is, I need to escape it.

00:19:55.166 --> 00:19:56.541
I have to find my sister.

00:19:57.666 --> 00:19:59.208
To leave,

00:19:59.291 --> 00:20:00.958
you have to survive first.

00:20:10.625 --> 00:20:14.000
Damn it. Bullheads and Horsefaces.
Their whole gang is here.

00:20:16.666 --> 00:20:18.791
Run! They're occupying the building!

00:20:18.875 --> 00:20:20.541
-Why?
-I don't know.

00:20:20.625 --> 00:20:22.416
But they'll kill everyone for sure.

00:20:23.791 --> 00:20:24.750
Hurry!

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.916
No exit that way. To the roof!

00:22:06.375 --> 00:22:07.416
Mr. Bull.

00:22:10.125 --> 00:22:12.333
Master Simon.

00:22:14.708 --> 00:22:16.125
Since I came to this city,

00:22:16.208 --> 00:22:19.291
every minute is life-and-death,

00:22:20.291 --> 00:22:22.125
that we've survived till now

00:22:24.625 --> 00:22:25.708
is no small feat.

00:22:26.708 --> 00:22:28.041
No small feat.

00:22:29.416 --> 00:22:33.333
You really want to fight all the time?

00:22:39.541 --> 00:22:41.125
They're already on the roof.

00:22:47.958 --> 00:22:50.708
Two tigers can't share one mountain.

00:22:50.791 --> 00:22:53.291
-Victory!
-Victory!

00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:59.041
When two tigers fight, one gets hurt.

00:22:59.583 --> 00:23:02.208
That one isn't necessarily me.

00:23:03.083 --> 00:23:05.583
It's time we worked that out.

00:23:05.666 --> 00:23:08.625
No time like the present.

00:23:09.875 --> 00:23:10.916
You've got a point.

00:23:34.791 --> 00:23:35.958
Follow me.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.166
Sister Sun…

00:26:24.500 --> 00:26:25.333
Go!

00:26:25.416 --> 00:26:26.583
Hurry!

00:27:37.416 --> 00:27:38.250
Run!

00:27:55.125 --> 00:27:56.458
Get in. Hurry!

00:28:41.666 --> 00:28:44.208
These demons are getting out of control.

00:28:45.208 --> 00:28:48.291
In the beginning,
they would appear once a month.

00:28:48.916 --> 00:28:51.291
Now, it's every few days!

00:28:51.375 --> 00:28:52.500
So true, Third Lieutenant.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:58.458
Asuraville's cycles
of storm, fire, flood, and poison gas,

00:28:58.541 --> 00:29:01.291
the four kalpas,
bring on the evil spirits.

00:29:01.375 --> 00:29:03.708
The kalpas go faster and faster

00:29:03.791 --> 00:29:06.041
and it's harder and harder to survive.

00:29:06.125 --> 00:29:09.833
So we have to unite and power up,

00:29:09.916 --> 00:29:11.291
conserve our strength,

00:29:11.375 --> 00:29:13.416
not open our doors to just anyone.

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:15.375
That's right.

00:29:15.458 --> 00:29:18.708
Humans and demons don't belong here.

00:29:18.791 --> 00:29:20.750
This is Raksha territory.

00:29:42.125 --> 00:29:43.750
I'm neither a Raksha

00:29:44.333 --> 00:29:46.333
nor a monster.

00:29:48.250 --> 00:29:52.250
Simon kept us Rakshas
from being wiped out.

00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:56.750
We swore to make him our leader.

00:29:57.833 --> 00:30:01.458
Third Lieutenant and Fourth Lieutenant,
we welcome humans and demons

00:30:02.125 --> 00:30:04.833
because they're useful.

00:30:04.916 --> 00:30:06.958
And her? What use is she?

00:30:12.083 --> 00:30:13.750
Cursed little demon!

00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:56.958
Little Raksha, how vain you are.

00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.958
I'm not afraid of this stinking mud.

00:30:59.041 --> 00:31:00.375
I'm not afraid of you.

00:31:00.458 --> 00:31:02.416
And I'm not afraid of the Bull-Horses.

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:04.416
You boastful little demon!

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.500
Since you made me your leader,

00:31:16.250 --> 00:31:20.125
in these times,
I've done everything I could

00:31:20.208 --> 00:31:21.916
to live up to your expectations.

00:31:22.708 --> 00:31:23.916
However,

00:31:24.416 --> 00:31:26.333
regardless of the natural chaos

00:31:26.416 --> 00:31:28.500
or the reappearance of the evil spirits,

00:31:31.666 --> 00:31:35.125
supplies are our top priority.

00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:36.500
True.

00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:38.250
Second Lieutenant.

00:31:38.333 --> 00:31:39.916
We have food,

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.541
but fuel is low.

00:31:42.625 --> 00:31:44.875
At sunrise, the evil spirits will retreat,

00:31:45.583 --> 00:31:47.000
and I'll go to All-Good Market.

00:31:47.083 --> 00:31:48.708
All-Good Market?

00:31:49.291 --> 00:31:50.333
And she

00:31:50.958 --> 00:31:51.833
is going with me.

00:31:53.708 --> 00:31:54.958
Okay.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.916
If she can bring back supplies,

00:31:58.416 --> 00:32:02.166
the Rakshas will have a place for her.

00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:28.708
As soon as you're ready, we're off.

00:32:32.625 --> 00:32:33.833
I'll wait outside.

00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:53.125
These collapsing buildings
are pretty scary.

00:32:53.208 --> 00:32:56.250
But they expel stuff like cars and food

00:32:56.333 --> 00:32:59.333
just like tides dump fish on the beach.

00:33:08.625 --> 00:33:11.291
What kind of people end up here?

00:33:12.250 --> 00:33:13.833
People who aren't ready.

00:33:14.625 --> 00:33:16.541
Those who resist leaving this life

00:33:16.625 --> 00:33:17.958
for another reincarnation.

00:33:20.875 --> 00:33:21.875
True.

00:33:22.541 --> 00:33:23.541
I'm resisting.

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.500
My sister and I were so close.

00:33:26.583 --> 00:33:28.875
Then she fell in love with a weakling.

00:33:29.375 --> 00:33:30.750
If she had to fall in love,

00:33:30.833 --> 00:33:33.708
why not pick a man
strong enough to protect her?

00:33:41.250 --> 00:33:43.208
Not many men are stronger than you.

00:33:45.833 --> 00:33:48.083
The Bull-Horses. What's their story?

00:33:48.666 --> 00:33:49.833
Them?

00:33:49.916 --> 00:33:51.250
They're a monster clan.

00:33:51.791 --> 00:33:54.083
In Asuraville, besides humans and demons,

00:33:54.166 --> 00:33:56.708
there are monsters
like Bull-Horses and Rakshas.

00:33:57.333 --> 00:33:58.458
And those evil spirits?

00:33:59.333 --> 00:34:01.166
They once were humans,
demons, or monsters.

00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:04.458
No one knows where they came from.

00:34:04.958 --> 00:34:08.041
But if they bite you, you turn into one.

00:34:27.166 --> 00:34:29.541
You're a lousy driver.

00:35:37.833 --> 00:35:38.750
Let's go.

00:35:43.416 --> 00:35:45.083
Everyone in Asuraville agreed,

00:35:45.166 --> 00:35:48.333
the area from here on
belongs to All-Good Market.

00:35:49.250 --> 00:35:51.041
It's neutral ground, can't be invaded.

00:35:53.541 --> 00:35:55.125
This Asuraville…

00:35:56.375 --> 00:35:57.958
The boss of All-Good Market.

00:35:58.041 --> 00:35:59.583
She knows it best.

00:36:19.208 --> 00:36:20.291
Give it to me.

00:37:28.625 --> 00:37:30.041
Stop him!

00:37:33.666 --> 00:37:34.958
How dare you!

00:37:36.625 --> 00:37:37.500
It's you.

00:37:39.458 --> 00:37:40.291
You know him?

00:37:40.791 --> 00:37:42.541
When I first got here, he saved me.

00:38:01.125 --> 00:38:02.458
Gosh.

00:38:02.541 --> 00:38:04.291
We have visitors.

00:38:09.791 --> 00:38:14.250
You wanted to know Asuraville's origins?

00:38:14.833 --> 00:38:17.375
Asuraville, what's it all about?

00:38:17.458 --> 00:38:18.625
Why am I here?

00:38:20.833 --> 00:38:22.416
Here you go.

00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.916
It seems you know two of my old customers.

00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:29.250
I'll tell you. Why not?

00:38:31.333 --> 00:38:33.833
The most agonizing thing in the world

00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:36.875
is unfulfilled desire.

00:38:37.791 --> 00:38:43.541
Worldly frustration
gave rise to Asuraville.

00:38:45.208 --> 00:38:46.416
You can't reincarnate.

00:38:46.500 --> 00:38:49.000
Traveling through time, you end up here

00:38:49.083 --> 00:38:53.208
thanks to the strength of your obsession.

00:38:53.291 --> 00:38:54.375
Obsession?

00:38:55.500 --> 00:38:58.125
It's what you can't get or give up.

00:38:58.208 --> 00:39:01.000
It torments you
with all kinds of resentment.

00:39:01.083 --> 00:39:02.916
That is obsession.

00:39:03.458 --> 00:39:05.541
That unsatisfied desire

00:39:05.625 --> 00:39:07.791
concentrates itself on an object

00:39:07.875 --> 00:39:10.333
that you arrive here with.

00:39:13.458 --> 00:39:17.958
It's the symbol of your obsession.

00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:22.000
True, this gourd's love potions
torment me.

00:39:24.333 --> 00:39:27.125
So how can I get out of here?

00:39:28.250 --> 00:39:29.125
Come with me.

00:39:47.708 --> 00:39:49.458
Since all suffering

00:39:49.541 --> 00:39:51.916
comes from an attachment,

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:53.750
to stop suffering,

00:39:53.833 --> 00:39:56.833
let go of what you desire.

00:39:57.625 --> 00:39:59.666
This pool of water

00:39:59.750 --> 00:40:02.250
is called Release.

00:40:03.083 --> 00:40:06.333
Dive in and you'll escape.

00:40:06.416 --> 00:40:07.458
It's as easy as that?

00:40:08.291 --> 00:40:09.458
Of course.

00:40:11.583 --> 00:40:14.333
The Pool of Release is amazing.

00:40:15.125 --> 00:40:18.250
Enter and all things will disappear,

00:40:18.750 --> 00:40:21.208
with that little obsession included.

00:40:23.250 --> 00:40:25.125
But before jumping,

00:40:25.208 --> 00:40:27.041
everyone hesitates.

00:40:28.541 --> 00:40:29.750
See?

00:40:31.250 --> 00:40:32.458
Why is that?

00:40:32.541 --> 00:40:35.000
Because they see in the water

00:40:35.083 --> 00:40:38.833
the very thing that torments them.

00:40:43.250 --> 00:40:44.458
I'm not ready.

00:40:44.541 --> 00:40:47.416
Give me more time. I'll pass that exam!

00:40:47.916 --> 00:40:49.333
I'll pass it for sure.

00:40:50.708 --> 00:40:52.416
I'll pass it for sure.

00:40:53.125 --> 00:40:56.166
So much sorrow

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.500
Who can I tell?

00:41:00.083 --> 00:41:05.708
A misplaced love and there I fell

00:41:07.125 --> 00:41:11.125
How to put aside

00:41:11.208 --> 00:41:15.166
Such beautiful infatuation?

00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:20.583
In rain and wind

00:41:20.666 --> 00:41:24.666
I dwell

00:42:11.708 --> 00:42:13.250
Fantastic!

00:42:13.333 --> 00:42:15.416
The Peach Blossom Fairy has freed herself!

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.583
A piece of her soul

00:42:17.666 --> 00:42:19.625
was attached to that jade.

00:42:24.375 --> 00:42:26.958
Now, it's over.

00:42:27.041 --> 00:42:30.041
Both attachment and soul are gone.

00:42:30.125 --> 00:42:33.583
She has been cleansed of it all.

00:42:34.375 --> 00:42:37.833
And so, she has left Asuraville.

00:42:58.291 --> 00:43:00.333
Why isn't my obsession clear to me?

00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.583
It's because your memory is flawed.

00:43:24.125 --> 00:43:25.041
Verta.

00:43:27.791 --> 00:43:28.875
Blanca.

00:43:35.875 --> 00:43:37.750
Whatever he looks like

00:43:38.333 --> 00:43:40.333
or whether he remembers me or not,

00:43:40.416 --> 00:43:42.083
I have to find him.

00:43:43.333 --> 00:43:44.541
It's because

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:46.500
I remember.

00:43:47.291 --> 00:43:49.541
Why must you remember?

00:43:49.625 --> 00:43:50.625
Why?

00:43:51.208 --> 00:43:52.458
Why?

00:43:52.958 --> 00:43:53.833
Why?

00:44:00.250 --> 00:44:01.583
Do you want to take the leap?

00:44:02.166 --> 00:44:05.375
You'll leave Asuraville if you do.

00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:08.500
You'll forget the person in the pool.

00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.750
Your memory gone. You'll be released.

00:44:21.041 --> 00:44:23.750
It's hard to jump.

00:44:24.583 --> 00:44:26.125
I knew you wouldn't.

00:44:26.666 --> 00:44:27.916
If you're in Asuraville,

00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:30.416
it's because you can't let go.

00:44:33.416 --> 00:44:34.291
Goodbye.

00:44:34.916 --> 00:44:36.208
I guess this is goodbye.

00:44:58.416 --> 00:44:59.416
Another kalpa.

00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:01.375
And it's not even 24 hours!

00:45:07.333 --> 00:45:09.291
Run! It's coming our way!

00:45:24.666 --> 00:45:25.625
Let's go!

00:45:34.333 --> 00:45:36.208
These kalpas, what are they?

00:45:36.875 --> 00:45:38.250
Cycles of calamity.

00:45:38.333 --> 00:45:41.166
It's the respiration of Asuraville.

00:45:41.750 --> 00:45:43.333
Between breaths,

00:45:43.416 --> 00:45:48.333
it tries to eliminate
those that won't leave.

00:45:54.875 --> 00:45:56.041
Hurry, to the Pool of Release!

00:46:20.458 --> 00:46:21.958
-Hurry! Get in!
-Verta, hurry!

00:46:49.250 --> 00:46:50.416
Hurry!

00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:12.833
My brush!

00:48:31.666 --> 00:48:33.458
No!

00:48:47.916 --> 00:48:49.625
If you don't cut off their heads,

00:48:49.708 --> 00:48:51.166
you can't kill them.

00:49:04.833 --> 00:49:06.708
Our supplies were burned.

00:49:09.708 --> 00:49:11.125
We have to walk back.

00:49:16.375 --> 00:49:17.750
Are you okay?

00:49:17.833 --> 00:49:18.958
Yes.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:23.125
Simon, why don't we take him with us?

00:49:26.166 --> 00:49:27.375
Why did the guy you saved

00:49:27.458 --> 00:49:28.791
turn around and hurt you?

00:49:28.875 --> 00:49:30.541
This is Asuraville.

00:49:30.625 --> 00:49:32.333
Do you think you're a bodhisattva?

00:49:32.416 --> 00:49:34.333
Do you have
a bodhisattva's special powers?

00:49:34.416 --> 00:49:36.166
You're just a bad imitation.

00:49:37.833 --> 00:49:39.166
His heart is good, but he's weak.

00:49:39.250 --> 00:49:40.958
He hurts others, including himself.

00:49:41.041 --> 00:49:42.500
I've seen people like this.

00:49:43.833 --> 00:49:45.958
But he still saved me.

00:49:46.041 --> 00:49:47.750
Let's take him back to Raksha territory.

00:49:48.666 --> 00:49:51.125
I can't take in someone without a face.

00:49:57.833 --> 00:49:59.958
A man with such a face,
walking in Asuraville,

00:50:01.125 --> 00:50:02.333
is a perfect fit.

00:50:04.458 --> 00:50:05.375
Okay.

00:50:05.958 --> 00:50:07.166
I'll take him.

00:50:22.416 --> 00:50:23.291
Where are the Rakshas?

00:50:24.916 --> 00:50:25.916
Something is wrong.

00:50:26.458 --> 00:50:27.833
We'll enter through the secret passage.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:11.833
Go! Get out of here!

00:51:24.541 --> 00:51:26.375
I'll take you all on!

00:51:33.333 --> 00:51:34.416
Let's go.

00:51:56.791 --> 00:51:57.666
Third Lieutenant!

00:52:44.083 --> 00:52:47.625
Today, all you Rakshas will die.

00:52:50.041 --> 00:52:51.541
Where's Simon?

00:52:55.041 --> 00:52:56.625
You missed him.

00:52:57.166 --> 00:53:00.583
He'll be back for revenge.

00:53:12.125 --> 00:53:13.291
Victory!

00:53:13.375 --> 00:53:19.458
-Victory!
-Victory!

00:53:20.083 --> 00:53:22.291
We defeated the Rakshas today

00:53:23.750 --> 00:53:25.916
thanks to your efforts.

00:53:28.791 --> 00:53:31.250
Out with the old, in with the new.

00:53:31.833 --> 00:53:33.916
Heaven's law.

00:53:42.916 --> 00:53:45.416
The city of Asuraville,

00:53:46.125 --> 00:53:48.250
the form of a moment.

00:53:48.333 --> 00:53:50.416
-Life is brief.
-Life is brief.

00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.666
-Kalpas run their course.
-Kalpas run their course.

00:54:02.708 --> 00:54:03.750
Rise.

00:54:04.333 --> 00:54:06.291
You are now Defenders.

00:54:07.125 --> 00:54:11.500
Let everyone see the new faces
you have chosen.

00:54:11.583 --> 00:54:15.791
-Victory!
-Victory!

00:54:27.416 --> 00:54:29.083
I'll rise again.

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:32.041
Just wait and see.

00:54:52.250 --> 00:54:53.583
A flood kalpa! Run!

00:55:26.541 --> 00:55:28.208
Hurry, there's a door over there.

00:55:42.541 --> 00:55:44.291
He's a burden!

00:55:44.375 --> 00:55:46.416
Verta, let's flee this place.

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.250
Hand in hand, we'll rise again.

00:55:49.333 --> 00:55:50.333
One day,

00:55:50.416 --> 00:55:52.416
we'll escape Asuraville.

00:56:01.250 --> 00:56:02.333
Don't worry about me.

00:56:02.416 --> 00:56:04.125
Go.

00:56:17.708 --> 00:56:19.916
Simon.

00:56:28.750 --> 00:56:29.875
Simon?

00:56:31.041 --> 00:56:32.208
Simon!

00:56:33.125 --> 00:56:34.041
Verta.

00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.458
If this is how it is,

00:56:37.125 --> 00:56:39.250
you've become a burden too.

00:56:43.875 --> 00:56:45.125
Simon!

00:57:08.833 --> 00:57:12.250
Strong or weak, men are all the same.

00:57:12.833 --> 00:57:14.541
When it comes to the crunch,

00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:16.208
they run.

00:57:19.000 --> 00:57:21.291
Why did I end up in Asuraville?

00:57:21.375 --> 00:57:23.458
I've struggled at death's door.

00:57:23.541 --> 00:57:26.541
But what's the point in resisting?

00:57:28.791 --> 00:57:30.333
It's only to know

00:57:30.416 --> 00:57:32.541
what the world is like.

00:57:34.166 --> 00:57:35.250
Blanca.

00:57:36.541 --> 00:57:37.750
Blanca.

00:57:40.416 --> 00:57:42.125
Verta.

00:57:44.708 --> 00:57:47.208
Maybe to get bitten by these creatures

00:57:47.291 --> 00:57:49.208
and lose all consciousness

00:57:49.291 --> 00:57:50.916
would be a kind of release.

00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.291
Verta!

00:57:58.458 --> 00:57:59.791
Verta!

00:58:08.583 --> 00:58:09.541
Verta!

00:58:10.125 --> 00:58:11.625
Look at me!

00:58:19.250 --> 00:58:20.375
Verta.

00:58:23.208 --> 00:58:24.583
Keep going!

00:58:25.500 --> 00:58:26.458
Blanca!

00:58:26.958 --> 00:58:27.833
You're Blanca!

00:58:28.416 --> 00:58:29.583
Careful!

01:00:17.125 --> 01:00:18.291
Blanca.

01:00:19.208 --> 01:00:21.083
It's another twilight.

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.291
How many have we seen together?

01:00:45.416 --> 01:00:46.250
You don't recall

01:00:46.333 --> 01:00:47.791
being trapped under the pagoda?

01:00:47.875 --> 01:00:49.041
How did you escape?

01:00:49.125 --> 01:00:50.291
Who are you?

01:00:50.375 --> 01:00:52.416
Why are you in a man's body?

01:00:53.541 --> 01:00:54.708
Of my past,

01:00:55.416 --> 01:00:56.375
I have no memory.

01:00:57.541 --> 01:01:00.041
All I recall is crossing a road.

01:01:01.125 --> 01:01:02.333
The light changed.

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:03.666
There was a truck.

01:01:07.958 --> 01:01:09.416
I flew into the air.

01:01:10.583 --> 01:01:12.583
Time seemed to stop.

01:01:17.166 --> 01:01:18.541
What happened?

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:20.666
{\an8}Why was I still in the air?

01:01:21.791 --> 01:01:22.666
{\an8}It couldn't be.

01:01:22.750 --> 01:01:24.000
{\an8}Someone was waiting for me.

01:01:26.833 --> 01:01:28.375
{\an8}Time stopped.

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:34.083
I know the feeling.

01:01:36.166 --> 01:01:37.916
Then my face hit the ground.

01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:39.458
When I came to,

01:01:39.541 --> 01:01:41.500
I was lying on concrete.

01:01:42.166 --> 01:01:45.250
There was fire all around, everywhere.

01:01:47.750 --> 01:01:49.083
And I arrived here.

01:02:03.041 --> 01:02:05.083
This bone flute in my hands,

01:02:05.625 --> 01:02:07.125
I still don't know

01:02:07.208 --> 01:02:09.875
why this represents my obsession.

01:02:10.916 --> 01:02:12.083
All I know

01:02:12.666 --> 01:02:14.375
is I have to leave here.

01:02:15.333 --> 01:02:17.000
I need to find that person

01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:19.125
whose faint image

01:02:20.125 --> 01:02:21.666
I saw in the pool.

01:02:55.916 --> 01:02:57.125
Asuraville.

01:02:58.041 --> 01:03:00.000
It's like the outside world.

01:03:00.083 --> 01:03:02.833
Only the strong survive.

01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:08.625
My sister loved a man whose heart

01:03:08.708 --> 01:03:10.041
was greater than his ability.

01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.333
So I thought,

01:03:12.416 --> 01:03:15.083
if I ever fall in love,

01:03:15.166 --> 01:03:17.625
it will be with someone strong,

01:03:19.625 --> 01:03:22.791
who would protect me in times of trouble.

01:03:23.625 --> 01:03:26.541
I came to Asuraville and met Simon.

01:03:27.833 --> 01:03:30.083
But he's just another selfish man.

01:03:31.541 --> 01:03:33.083
In the face of danger,

01:03:33.166 --> 01:03:34.791
he lies and sells you out.

01:03:34.875 --> 01:03:36.083
It's the same old story.

01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:47.583
So maybe my sister was right.

01:03:47.666 --> 01:03:50.416
In the end, strength is irrelevant.

01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:52.041
Maybe,

01:03:52.125 --> 01:03:55.000
if his heart is true, that's enough.

01:03:59.375 --> 01:04:01.041
You don't remember me.

01:04:01.125 --> 01:04:02.791
So when I got here,

01:04:02.875 --> 01:04:04.083
why did you save me?

01:04:06.583 --> 01:04:07.750
I can't explain it.

01:04:08.791 --> 01:04:10.541
I just knew I had to do it.

01:04:11.166 --> 01:04:13.083
No matter how dangerous it was.

01:04:13.166 --> 01:04:15.500
Really, it was like that.

01:04:16.250 --> 01:04:17.750
When I saw you,

01:04:17.833 --> 01:04:19.125
you felt so familiar.

01:04:23.375 --> 01:04:24.833
Early on, you forgot,

01:04:25.625 --> 01:04:27.166
but then seemed to remember.

01:04:28.500 --> 01:04:29.541
I understand.

01:04:32.416 --> 01:04:33.458
Blanca.

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.833
In any case, you're here in Asuraville.

01:04:37.666 --> 01:04:39.458
And we're together again.

01:04:40.125 --> 01:04:41.500
It's great.

01:06:10.333 --> 01:06:12.500
The boss of All-Good Market.

01:06:12.583 --> 01:06:15.375
Does she have other ways of leaving?

01:06:16.875 --> 01:06:17.833
In all Asuraville,

01:06:17.916 --> 01:06:20.958
only she came on her own accord.

01:06:21.708 --> 01:06:23.541
She knows the way out for sure.

01:06:24.208 --> 01:06:25.916
Will she help us?

01:06:26.458 --> 01:06:29.208
I heard she came to Asuraville

01:06:29.291 --> 01:06:31.500
because the people and demons here

01:06:31.583 --> 01:06:33.416
all have something she wants.

01:06:35.833 --> 01:06:37.333
She's a merchant.

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:42.125
It's true, I'm a merchant.

01:06:42.916 --> 01:06:45.125
You want to leave Asuraville,

01:06:45.208 --> 01:06:47.791
but can you give me what I want?

01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:51.208
What do you want? Name it.

01:06:54.250 --> 01:06:55.333
Come.

01:06:59.958 --> 01:07:03.666
In the human world,
I run a small business.

01:07:03.750 --> 01:07:05.125
It's a workshop.

01:07:05.708 --> 01:07:09.791
That little workshop has smelters

01:07:09.875 --> 01:07:12.041
that need lots of fuel every day.

01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:16.500
That fuel comes from your obsessions.

01:07:17.125 --> 01:07:20.166
The stronger they are,
the fiercer their obsessions,

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:21.958
the harder they burn.

01:07:23.916 --> 01:07:27.958
What I want from both of you

01:07:29.291 --> 01:07:31.333
are your obsessions.

01:07:35.416 --> 01:07:37.250
Just before you both got here,

01:07:37.333 --> 01:07:41.208
a disillusioned soul,
at the end of his rope,

01:07:41.291 --> 01:07:42.791
came to do business with me.

01:07:43.375 --> 01:07:46.583
He also wants to leave Asuraville.

01:07:48.958 --> 01:07:50.208
Verta!

01:07:50.916 --> 01:07:51.875
Simon!

01:07:52.583 --> 01:07:57.500
Do you have a grudge against Simon?

01:07:59.375 --> 01:08:00.375
No.

01:08:03.708 --> 01:08:05.125
Simon,

01:08:05.208 --> 01:08:08.583
have you thought it through?

01:08:11.041 --> 01:08:11.958
Do it!

01:08:21.416 --> 01:08:25.250
There's another way to leave.

01:08:25.958 --> 01:08:27.375
Wish Bridge.

01:08:28.875 --> 01:08:30.333
Although it's hard,

01:08:30.416 --> 01:08:32.500
there are advantages.

01:08:32.583 --> 01:08:34.833
You can escape intact from Asuraville

01:08:34.916 --> 01:08:37.083
with your body and memories.

01:08:38.125 --> 01:08:40.041
Simon's choice

01:08:40.625 --> 01:08:42.625
was of course that one.

01:08:51.666 --> 01:08:55.875
His obsession was fierce

01:08:58.041 --> 01:09:00.416
and thus an excellent fuel.

01:09:21.416 --> 01:09:24.458
If I take this obsession,

01:09:24.541 --> 01:09:28.458
the drive to compete will fade.

01:09:28.541 --> 01:09:30.750
You'll be weak.

01:09:31.416 --> 01:09:33.125
Would you be willing?

01:09:35.125 --> 01:09:37.833
Strong or weak, what does it matter?

01:09:37.916 --> 01:09:39.666
So long as we can leave Asuraville

01:09:39.750 --> 01:09:41.833
and be together for a while,

01:09:42.458 --> 01:09:43.333
I'll do anything.

01:09:44.750 --> 01:09:46.458
And you?

01:09:50.541 --> 01:09:51.541
Of course I'm willing.

01:09:52.625 --> 01:09:54.541
Good, it's a deal.

01:09:59.416 --> 01:10:00.375
Look.

01:10:00.958 --> 01:10:04.625
Asuraville is shaped like a snake.

01:10:04.708 --> 01:10:08.708
Its head and tail almost meet.

01:10:08.791 --> 01:10:10.250
The intriguing thing is

01:10:10.333 --> 01:10:12.166
that the tail

01:10:12.250 --> 01:10:15.958
is where the evil spirits nest.

01:10:16.625 --> 01:10:17.875
Even more amazing.

01:10:17.958 --> 01:10:20.833
The snake's tail, at times,

01:10:20.916 --> 01:10:24.875
grows a little bridge at its tip.

01:10:24.958 --> 01:10:27.875
That's the Wish Bridge.

01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:30.125
If you jump from there

01:10:30.208 --> 01:10:31.875
into the snake's mouth,

01:10:32.583 --> 01:10:34.958
you will leave Asuraville.

01:10:57.458 --> 01:11:01.500
You have to take care with the jump.

01:11:01.583 --> 01:11:03.791
You've got only one moment to do it in.

01:11:04.333 --> 01:11:05.333
When is that?

01:11:06.708 --> 01:11:08.250
Little Demon,

01:11:08.333 --> 01:11:10.125
I'm a businesswoman.

01:11:10.208 --> 01:11:12.041
When the deal is done,

01:11:12.125 --> 01:11:13.958
I'll tell you.

01:11:18.458 --> 01:11:20.208
Since we've met before,

01:11:20.791 --> 01:11:22.333
even if the deal can't be done,

01:11:22.416 --> 01:11:25.875
I'll let you in on a secret anyway.

01:11:27.208 --> 01:11:31.291
About the timing of the bridge…

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.125
Bullheads!

01:11:38.333 --> 01:11:39.916
They only just destroyed the Rakshas

01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.875
and they're already smashing up my market?

01:12:00.916 --> 01:12:02.166
Raise the iron chains!

01:13:04.833 --> 01:13:05.750
Cut it!

01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:20.208
Attack that boat!

01:13:34.750 --> 01:13:35.708
Take it.

01:14:09.041 --> 01:14:10.291
Get up there!

01:14:11.875 --> 01:14:14.583
Boss, the fire wrecked our defenses.

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:16.541
Retreat to the Pool of Release?

01:14:16.625 --> 01:14:17.708
Let's go.

01:14:38.833 --> 01:14:41.541
Master Simon, your old friend is here.

01:14:42.375 --> 01:14:43.375
Him?

01:14:44.208 --> 01:14:45.791
What does he want with this place?

01:14:45.875 --> 01:14:48.583
He wants all of Asuraville.

01:14:53.708 --> 01:14:54.666
That was fast.

01:15:09.250 --> 01:15:11.375
Master Simon, I'm sorry.

01:15:11.458 --> 01:15:13.000
We're trapped.

01:15:23.125 --> 01:15:25.791
Boss, this Wish Bridge…

01:15:25.875 --> 01:15:27.666
I'm afraid I won't make it.

01:15:29.916 --> 01:15:31.500
But I still need to thank you.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:33.416
It's amazing, but shedding my obsession

01:15:34.083 --> 01:15:36.000
gave me instant joy.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:40.125
It's just business. No need to thank me.

01:15:47.958 --> 01:15:49.208
Verta,

01:15:49.291 --> 01:15:50.750
I'm sorry about before.

01:15:52.791 --> 01:15:54.083
Goodbye for now.

01:16:49.166 --> 01:16:50.250
Simon.

01:16:50.833 --> 01:16:53.458
Today, we'll finish this.

01:16:54.916 --> 01:16:56.375
Finish?

01:16:58.666 --> 01:17:02.083
How do you know this is the end?

01:17:13.208 --> 01:17:14.500
Simon!

01:17:21.583 --> 01:17:22.416
Careful!

01:17:30.291 --> 01:17:31.416
Blanca!

01:17:32.666 --> 01:17:33.666
Blanca?

01:17:52.291 --> 01:17:56.625
Today, I've united all of Asuraville.

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:01.375
Boss,

01:18:02.166 --> 01:18:04.875
why won't a talent like you join me?

01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:09.291
To join you,

01:18:09.375 --> 01:18:13.000
does one have to lock on
a human skin mask?

01:18:15.625 --> 01:18:17.625
Boss.

01:18:17.708 --> 01:18:21.541
Do you know how I found you so quickly?

01:18:24.833 --> 01:18:27.875
Everyone here knows

01:18:27.958 --> 01:18:30.791
that if you put on this mask,

01:18:30.875 --> 01:18:33.000
you can change your appearance

01:18:33.083 --> 01:18:36.583
into anything you want.

01:18:37.083 --> 01:18:38.541
But few know

01:18:39.041 --> 01:18:43.583
that the mask has another small use.

01:18:47.250 --> 01:18:50.208
It gives off a faint smell.

01:18:50.833 --> 01:18:53.250
Wherever he goes,

01:18:53.333 --> 01:18:56.375
I can track him down.

01:18:57.291 --> 01:19:01.625
The market's layout was clear as day.

01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000
You did very well this time.

01:19:06.083 --> 01:19:08.708
It was worth giving you this mask

01:19:08.791 --> 01:19:10.250
and saving your life.

01:19:11.208 --> 01:19:12.750
Blanca?

01:19:14.375 --> 01:19:17.625
Only after unhooking his mask,

01:19:17.708 --> 01:19:19.541
did I realize this famous knight-errant

01:19:19.625 --> 01:19:21.625
was our master's spy.

01:19:21.708 --> 01:19:24.625
Our master is a great strategist.

01:19:25.583 --> 01:19:26.916
You're not Blanca?

01:19:28.083 --> 01:19:29.458
Who are you, really?

01:19:48.125 --> 01:19:49.375
You liar.

01:19:50.250 --> 01:19:52.750
How could I believe you were Blanca?

01:19:54.041 --> 01:19:56.166
Put on this human skin mask

01:19:56.250 --> 01:20:01.291
and rise as a Defender.

01:20:01.375 --> 01:20:03.708
The city of Asuraville,

01:20:03.791 --> 01:20:05.875
the form of a moment.

01:20:09.250 --> 01:20:11.208
Life is brief.

01:20:16.875 --> 01:20:19.500
Kalpas run their course.

01:20:21.750 --> 01:20:28.333
-Victory!
-Victory!

01:20:28.416 --> 01:20:31.833
-Victory!
-Victory!

01:20:55.166 --> 01:20:56.208
He changed back to his human face?

01:20:56.291 --> 01:20:58.583
Doesn't he want to become a Defender?

01:21:03.583 --> 01:21:05.666
I just realized

01:21:05.750 --> 01:21:07.458
to give face but get rejected,

01:21:07.541 --> 01:21:10.208
that's so embarrassing.

01:21:13.208 --> 01:21:15.125
Let me tell you something.

01:21:16.250 --> 01:21:18.000
When a kalpa begins,

01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:23.375
throw yourself in.

01:21:51.916 --> 01:21:55.125
You can have this Pool of Release!

01:22:23.333 --> 01:22:24.208
Verta!

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.125
Leader! Help me!

01:23:02.291 --> 01:23:03.458
Verta!

01:23:03.541 --> 01:23:04.541
Verta!

01:23:19.708 --> 01:23:20.916
Verta!

01:24:42.250 --> 01:24:44.333
Who are you really?

01:24:46.791 --> 01:24:48.750
Who are you?

01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:01.291
When I first got to Asuraville,

01:25:01.875 --> 01:25:04.250
I had no memory and a ruined face.

01:25:05.250 --> 01:25:07.333
The Bullhead leader saved me.

01:25:09.291 --> 01:25:10.958
He gave me

01:25:11.041 --> 01:25:12.750
my life.

01:25:14.333 --> 01:25:15.958
But the day I saw you,

01:25:16.041 --> 01:25:18.291
I don't know why, I…

01:25:19.875 --> 01:25:21.583
Then in the Pool of Release,

01:25:21.666 --> 01:25:23.250
I saw that face.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.375
You called her Blanca.

01:25:26.666 --> 01:25:28.208
While in the tunnel,

01:25:28.291 --> 01:25:29.166
I thought

01:25:29.958 --> 01:25:32.083
if I changed to look like Blanca,

01:25:32.166 --> 01:25:33.583
maybe you would listen to me--

01:25:33.666 --> 01:25:34.791
But you're not her!

01:25:40.583 --> 01:25:41.958
No, I'm not.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.416
Nor am I strong enough

01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:47.666
to protect you in Asuraville.

01:26:01.083 --> 01:26:02.375
Strength doesn't matter.

01:26:03.250 --> 01:26:04.833
The strong can lie,

01:26:05.541 --> 01:26:07.875
as can the weak.

01:26:14.541 --> 01:26:16.000
But you know,

01:26:16.833 --> 01:26:18.041
I understand

01:26:18.750 --> 01:26:20.625
I made a mistake.

01:26:22.416 --> 01:26:24.500
Why do I always rely on others?

01:26:25.041 --> 01:26:26.666
Weak or strong,

01:26:27.250 --> 01:26:29.250
they'll all hurt you.

01:26:29.333 --> 01:26:33.041
It's better for me to strengthen myself.

01:26:34.625 --> 01:26:35.958
Don't apologize.

01:26:36.541 --> 01:26:38.083
It's my mistake.

01:26:38.875 --> 01:26:40.500
I should've known

01:26:40.583 --> 01:26:43.375
that I can only rely on myself.

01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.416
I won't free myself from obsession.

01:26:47.958 --> 01:26:50.291
Nor will I rely on anyone else again.

01:26:50.833 --> 01:26:52.125
If I'm strong enough,

01:26:52.208 --> 01:26:53.916
I'll kill Fahai myself,

01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.083
overturn that pagoda,

01:26:55.166 --> 01:26:57.791
and release myself from Asuraville!

01:27:05.666 --> 01:27:07.291
At the pool,

01:27:07.375 --> 01:27:09.458
why did you change back to Blanca?

01:27:10.666 --> 01:27:11.708
I…

01:27:16.875 --> 01:27:18.375
Let's go.

01:27:18.458 --> 01:27:21.500
At the pool, that fox told me

01:27:21.583 --> 01:27:23.416
the secret of Wish Bridge.

01:27:55.416 --> 01:27:57.125
What makes the bridge grow

01:27:57.208 --> 01:27:59.833
is Asuraville's black wind tunnel.

01:27:59.916 --> 01:28:02.625
The tunnel is a place of karmic testing.

01:28:03.166 --> 01:28:05.083
If you can survive its many torments,

01:28:05.166 --> 01:28:06.458
you will achieve release.

01:28:06.541 --> 01:28:10.125
A path will extend
from the serpent's tail.

01:28:10.916 --> 01:28:12.416
That's the Wish Bridge.

01:28:19.750 --> 01:28:21.958
We're here. This is it.

01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:36.875
Hurry!

01:28:42.625 --> 01:28:43.708
Get in!

01:28:51.958 --> 01:28:54.416
That fox really sticks her neck out.

01:28:58.875 --> 01:28:59.833
Whatever.

01:29:00.416 --> 01:29:02.416
I'll do it for her and send you in.

01:29:05.958 --> 01:29:08.291
Little Demon,
you know why you're in Asuraville?

01:29:10.750 --> 01:29:13.666
Karma, twists of fate,
it's hard to say for sure.

01:29:14.541 --> 01:29:17.625
There's a reason
for your fear and loathing.

01:29:17.708 --> 01:29:19.750
And it's in that tunnel.

01:29:19.833 --> 01:29:22.916
It's a trial by fire.

01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.958
A lapse of will and you will burn to ash.

01:29:28.833 --> 01:29:30.666
Sure you want to go?

01:29:32.125 --> 01:29:33.750
Fear and loathing?

01:29:34.375 --> 01:29:35.958
I want to see for myself.

01:29:41.750 --> 01:29:44.166
Right. Look after yourself.

01:29:50.666 --> 01:29:52.083
Thank you.

01:30:23.125 --> 01:30:24.041
I'm going in.

01:30:29.458 --> 01:30:32.000
Verta!

01:30:35.583 --> 01:30:36.875
What's in there?

01:30:38.708 --> 01:30:39.875
Fahai.

01:30:42.666 --> 01:30:44.250
How long was I in there?

01:30:45.041 --> 01:30:46.916
Only a moment. Then you came flying out.

01:30:50.125 --> 01:30:52.041
It's an empty landscape

01:30:53.166 --> 01:30:54.875
and I was there for two hours.

01:30:54.958 --> 01:30:56.000
What?

01:31:01.416 --> 01:31:02.333
I'm going in.

01:31:38.041 --> 01:31:40.416
You're back, Little Demon.

01:31:41.250 --> 01:31:42.750
Stinking monk.

01:31:42.833 --> 01:31:45.208
I've wiped out so much evil,

01:31:45.291 --> 01:31:47.916
but some always get away.

01:31:48.916 --> 01:31:50.041
Little Demon,

01:31:50.625 --> 01:31:52.791
you should release yourself
from obsession.

01:31:53.375 --> 01:31:54.375
No way.

01:32:07.791 --> 01:32:09.666
He's connected to you.

01:32:09.750 --> 01:32:12.958
Living things
shouldn't be trapped by desire

01:32:13.041 --> 01:32:15.708
but should release themselves
through reincarnation.

01:32:15.791 --> 01:32:18.375
This city shouldn't exist.

01:32:19.125 --> 01:32:20.916
I gave him a golden aura as a talisman

01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.083
to help him conquer Asuraville.

01:32:23.166 --> 01:32:26.791
So he could kill those who wouldn't go,

01:32:27.416 --> 01:32:29.166
or force them to leave

01:32:29.250 --> 01:32:31.250
and be reincarnated.

01:32:31.750 --> 01:32:33.333
What reward did you give him

01:32:33.416 --> 01:32:34.833
to make him a slave to your will?

01:32:35.583 --> 01:32:39.208
When Asuraville is empty,
it will collapse and disappear.

01:32:39.291 --> 01:32:41.916
I'll stop him from falling into Hell

01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:43.708
and keep him whole

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:46.291
so he can go back to his world.

01:32:47.125 --> 01:32:48.666
Little Demon.

01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:50.916
You should release yourself too.

01:32:51.500 --> 01:32:55.500
Everything I do is to help people
into the next life.

01:32:55.583 --> 01:32:58.916
I don't need release or your help.

01:33:20.916 --> 01:33:22.000
Verta.

01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:56.375
Don't come here!

01:33:57.125 --> 01:33:58.041
I'm okay.

01:34:36.875 --> 01:34:40.375
Little Demon, years have passed.

01:34:40.458 --> 01:34:42.750
When will you stop?

01:34:43.333 --> 01:34:45.333
When I've defeated you

01:34:45.416 --> 01:34:47.333
and toppled the tower!

01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000
Verta!

01:35:20.666 --> 01:35:21.750
Verta!

01:35:57.875 --> 01:35:59.208
Your flute.

01:36:16.125 --> 01:36:17.166
Too tight?

01:36:18.166 --> 01:36:19.208
It's fine.

01:36:42.458 --> 01:36:44.625
It has been 20 years, Little Demon.

01:36:45.166 --> 01:36:48.875
You've never stopped harassing me.

01:36:48.958 --> 01:36:51.166
Not until you're overthrown,

01:36:51.250 --> 01:36:53.416
and the pagoda is toppled.

01:38:23.333 --> 01:38:27.250
Dharma is all-embracing,
but things do end.

01:38:27.333 --> 01:38:31.208
Not all that is sought is granted.

01:38:31.750 --> 01:38:33.583
That applies to me too.

01:38:34.375 --> 01:38:37.208
I am powerless.

01:38:38.208 --> 01:38:42.708
Good will prevail.

01:39:48.375 --> 01:39:49.333
Verta.

01:39:51.625 --> 01:39:53.916
We can leave Asuraville.

01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:40.083
"When a kalpa begins, throw yourself in."

01:40:41.041 --> 01:40:44.041
Twenty years inside is one day outside.

01:40:44.125 --> 01:40:45.458
You're free of your karma.

01:40:45.541 --> 01:40:47.666
Asuraville won't keep you any longer.

01:40:48.625 --> 01:40:50.416
Go, Little Demon.

01:40:57.583 --> 01:40:59.333
My golden aura!

01:41:07.916 --> 01:41:11.625
You tricked me, Monk!

01:41:12.416 --> 01:41:14.416
You tricked me!

01:41:24.500 --> 01:41:26.000
Wish Bridge!

01:41:27.333 --> 01:41:28.625
The fox said

01:41:29.208 --> 01:41:31.291
that when a kalpa begins,

01:41:31.375 --> 01:41:33.291
throw yourself in.

01:41:51.333 --> 01:41:52.666
What should I call you?

01:41:53.708 --> 01:41:55.041
I really don't remember my name.

01:41:55.958 --> 01:41:57.625
Call me what you like.

01:41:58.208 --> 01:41:59.541
It's only a name.

01:42:00.708 --> 01:42:03.500
Sure, it's only a name.

01:42:04.916 --> 01:42:06.208
From here,

01:42:06.291 --> 01:42:08.083
I'm going to find my sister.

01:42:08.875 --> 01:42:10.125
You can go and look

01:42:10.208 --> 01:42:12.583
for the person you saw in the pool.

01:44:11.500 --> 01:44:12.416
Let's go!

01:44:26.166 --> 01:44:27.083
Hurry!

01:44:56.875 --> 01:44:58.583
A kalpa is rising! A gas kalpa!

01:46:24.333 --> 01:46:25.708
Help me!

01:46:25.791 --> 01:46:27.125
Hurry, help me!

01:47:30.625 --> 01:47:31.625
Verta!

01:47:31.708 --> 01:47:32.625
Jump!

01:47:46.291 --> 01:47:47.250
Hurry!

01:47:54.208 --> 01:47:56.083
The bridge is collapsing. Hurry!

01:48:01.708 --> 01:48:02.875
I still haven't turned.

01:48:02.958 --> 01:48:04.958
Hang on.

01:48:05.583 --> 01:48:06.833
I want to leave.

01:48:06.916 --> 01:48:09.875
I can't change. I can't.

01:48:10.458 --> 01:48:12.583
I have to be able to get out.

01:48:15.708 --> 01:48:16.625
Quick!

01:48:19.541 --> 01:48:22.666
I can go back.

01:48:23.875 --> 01:48:25.291
Jump in…

01:48:25.375 --> 01:48:27.333
I'll be saved

01:48:27.416 --> 01:48:30.166
and go back home.

01:48:35.333 --> 01:48:36.500
Hurry!

01:49:58.458 --> 01:49:59.625
You!

01:50:23.583 --> 01:50:24.791
Why?

01:50:26.250 --> 01:50:28.500
Why did you let him bite you?

01:52:01.208 --> 01:52:02.041
No!

01:52:09.083 --> 01:52:10.125
No!

01:52:10.208 --> 01:52:11.416
{\an8}No!

01:52:19.666 --> 01:52:20.541
No!

01:52:21.958 --> 01:52:23.166
No!

01:52:25.000 --> 01:52:25.916
No!

01:52:28.333 --> 01:52:29.625
Don't.

01:52:44.750 --> 01:52:45.833
Verta.

01:52:47.375 --> 01:52:49.666
I can't leave Asuraville.

01:52:50.791 --> 01:52:52.083
{\an8}Tell me why!

01:52:52.583 --> 01:52:54.083
{\an8}Why?

01:53:08.250 --> 01:53:11.833
It was the day the insects awakened,

01:53:12.583 --> 01:53:14.500
and petals filled the air

01:53:15.166 --> 01:53:16.583
like now.

01:53:19.375 --> 01:53:21.250
I see

01:53:22.583 --> 01:53:24.833
the face in the water clearly now.

01:53:27.583 --> 01:53:28.875
Blanca!

01:53:29.833 --> 01:53:31.625
Blanca!

01:54:35.625 --> 01:54:42.583
HANGZHOU

01:54:44.083 --> 01:54:46.083
I left Asuraville

01:54:46.958 --> 01:54:49.250
and returned to the world of desire.

01:54:51.666 --> 01:54:53.333
That person in Asuraville…

01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:00.625
But no one knows

01:55:00.708 --> 01:55:02.958
where Asuraville is in the world.

01:55:04.708 --> 01:55:05.916
And there's my sister too.

01:55:07.666 --> 01:55:09.333
Leifeng Pagoda has collapsed.

01:55:10.125 --> 01:55:11.458
And her?

01:55:42.958 --> 01:55:45.208
Grandpa, that tower, is it Leifeng Pagoda?

01:55:46.041 --> 01:55:46.958
Yes.

01:55:49.416 --> 01:55:50.625
It didn't fall?

01:55:51.333 --> 01:55:54.041
It's still standing?

01:55:56.083 --> 01:55:59.375
No. It was rebuilt recently.

01:56:00.083 --> 01:56:01.416
Were you away?

01:56:01.500 --> 01:56:03.250
Everyone knows that.

01:56:03.333 --> 01:56:05.583
The old pagoda collapsed long ago.

01:56:06.166 --> 01:56:07.083
Collapsed?

01:56:07.166 --> 01:56:11.333
Yes, if it had really trapped White Snake,

01:56:11.416 --> 01:56:13.708
she would have been free years ago.

01:56:13.791 --> 01:56:17.958
Maybe she cleansed her karma
and has been reincarnated.

01:56:19.500 --> 01:56:21.916
She could be anywhere.

01:56:30.833 --> 01:56:33.458
You should go see the exhibition there.

01:56:33.541 --> 01:56:37.625
After the pagoda fell, they found things,

01:56:37.708 --> 01:56:40.208
treasures they've put on display.

01:56:50.541 --> 01:56:52.500
Come, look at this here.

01:56:53.208 --> 01:56:57.458
Now, here is a mystery of the tower.

01:56:58.458 --> 01:57:01.625
-It's a hairpin.
-Correct, it's a hairpin.

01:57:01.708 --> 01:57:04.583
Notice it's an ancient hairpin,

01:57:04.666 --> 01:57:07.458
but this hairpin

01:57:07.541 --> 01:57:09.458
is made of bone.

01:57:15.583 --> 01:57:18.541
But why was it under the tower

01:57:18.625 --> 01:57:19.958
and why was it broken?

01:57:20.041 --> 01:57:21.958
Where's the missing piece?

01:58:20.750 --> 01:58:22.333
Sister!

01:58:28.541 --> 01:58:29.458
You don't recall

01:58:29.541 --> 01:58:30.750
being trapped under the pagoda?

01:58:30.833 --> 01:58:31.708
How did you escape?

01:58:31.791 --> 01:58:32.833
Of my past,

01:58:32.916 --> 01:58:34.125
I have no memory.

01:58:35.083 --> 01:58:36.333
When I first got to Asuraville

01:58:36.416 --> 01:58:38.333
I had no memory and a ruined face.

01:58:38.416 --> 01:58:39.416
There was fire all around.

01:58:41.375 --> 01:58:42.375
You don't remember me.

01:58:42.458 --> 01:58:44.041
-Why did you save me?
-I'm not sure either.

01:58:44.125 --> 01:58:45.916
I just knew I had to do it.

01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:47.375
When I saw you, you felt so familiar.

01:58:47.458 --> 01:58:48.625
And this bone flute in my hands.

01:58:48.708 --> 01:58:50.333
I still don't know

01:58:50.875 --> 01:58:52.958
why this represents my obsession.

01:58:57.500 --> 01:58:58.625
Blanca.

01:59:00.625 --> 01:59:02.625
That person in Asuraville

01:59:03.250 --> 01:59:05.375
was you, right?

01:59:07.333 --> 01:59:09.375
You escaped

01:59:09.458 --> 01:59:11.500
and also went to Asuraville.

01:59:13.041 --> 01:59:14.333
Today, insects awaken.

01:59:14.416 --> 01:59:16.000
We two snake sisters

01:59:16.083 --> 01:59:17.000
will overturn Jinshan Temple.

01:59:17.083 --> 01:59:19.000
Sister!

01:59:19.750 --> 01:59:21.041
Verta.

01:59:21.125 --> 01:59:22.041
Keep going!

01:59:22.125 --> 01:59:23.916
Blanca!

01:59:24.708 --> 01:59:26.416
Why isn't my obsession clear to me?

01:59:30.416 --> 01:59:31.916
I need to find that person

01:59:32.458 --> 01:59:33.458
whose faint image

01:59:34.291 --> 01:59:35.916
I saw in the pool.

01:59:37.708 --> 01:59:38.875
{\an8}Tell me why!

01:59:39.458 --> 01:59:40.791
{\an8}Why?

01:59:42.333 --> 01:59:46.125
It was the day the insects awakened,

01:59:47.000 --> 01:59:48.958
and petals filled the air

01:59:49.541 --> 01:59:50.875
like now.

01:59:54.291 --> 01:59:55.625
I see

01:59:57.208 --> 01:59:59.583
the face in the water clearly now.

02:00:01.125 --> 02:00:03.500
It was the day the insects awakened,

02:00:03.583 --> 02:00:05.333
and petals filled the air.

02:00:07.708 --> 02:00:08.833
Blanca.

02:00:09.833 --> 02:00:12.250
All along, the person you were looking for

02:00:13.083 --> 02:00:14.583
was me.

02:00:31.500 --> 02:00:32.666
What do you want? Name it.

02:00:32.750 --> 02:00:35.500
You forgot your past life
and much of this one too,

02:00:35.583 --> 02:00:37.416
but you seem to remember something.

02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:39.458
I understand.

02:00:39.541 --> 02:00:41.541
I have to leave this place.

02:00:41.625 --> 02:00:43.625
There's someone waiting for me.

02:00:44.541 --> 02:00:45.958
What should I call you?

02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:48.416
I really don't remember my name.

02:00:49.291 --> 02:00:50.416
Call me what you like.

02:00:51.541 --> 02:00:52.875
It's only a name.

02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:55.083
From here,

02:00:55.166 --> 02:00:56.458
I'm going to find my sister.

02:00:57.083 --> 02:00:58.375
You can go and look

02:00:58.458 --> 02:01:00.541
for the person you saw in the pool.

02:02:30.791 --> 02:02:32.166
Verta?

02:02:44.291 --> 02:02:45.416
Blanca.

02:04:12.791 --> 02:04:19.791
STAY TUNED FOR POST-CREDIT SCENE

02:07:47.291 --> 02:07:50.708
Another thousand years!

02:07:51.958 --> 02:07:53.333
Where's the thing?

02:08:12.125 --> 02:08:14.333
My enemy is in sight.

02:08:15.625 --> 02:08:18.625
Revenge is mine!

02:08:40.458 --> 02:08:42.500
